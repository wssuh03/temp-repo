Summary of OSS lecture2

In this lecture, we learn how to create a repository and commit it to the main prorgram

Step 1. Create a branch
-What is a branch?
 A Branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named [main] and it is considered to be the definintive branch. You can create additional branches off of [main] in your repository. You can use branches to have different versions of a project at one time.
 By adding addintional branches, you could make edits without damaging the [main] version. Branches allow you to seperate your work from the [main] branch.

Step 2. Commit a new file
Commit the edit you made from the original [main] branch. You could think this as uploading a new version of branch.

Step 3. Open a pull request
By pulling a request, you could request to make a change in the [main] branch. If the request gets accepeted, the edited version you made becomes the new [main] branch

Step 4. Merge your pull request
In this step, you accept the pull request. You should be carefull because your this means you confirm to make a change in your [main] version branch.
